# Introduction
Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company, aims to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses below their actual values and sell them at higher prices. This project involves building a regression model with regularization to predict the actual value of prospective properties in Australia.

# Assignment Part-I
The primary objective is to build a regression model to predict the actual value of prospective properties. The model should identify:

# Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

# Assignment Part-II
This part consists of subjective questions to be answered in a PDF file. The questions focus on the optimal value of alpha for ridge and lasso regression, model robustness, and generalizability.

# Business Goal
The model will assist the management in understanding how house prices vary with different variables. This will help in formulating a business strategy focused on high-return areas and understanding the pricing dynamics of a new market.
